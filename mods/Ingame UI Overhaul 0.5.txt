Ingame UI Overhaul Version 0.5
Please message me if there is anything horribly game breaking.

Track stats live while in-game
Mod will display:
Total damage dealt
Total damage to each player
Total healing given
Total healing to each player
Score based off of kills, damage, healing, captures, & souls
Saves a .txt  & .csv file log in your MWW directory of past game stats.

Additional Features:
Ability to leave any game at any time by pressing ESCAPE
Completely removes forfeit from team games
Spell log showing past spells you have used
Removes the old Death Message popup (I plan to add this to kill log instead)
