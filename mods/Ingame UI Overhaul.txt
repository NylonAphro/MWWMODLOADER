Ingame UI Overhaul Version 0.7
Please message me if there is anything horribly game breaking.

*UPDATE 0.7*
1) press escape to show forfeit dialog & hold tab to vote
2) press shift + escape to bring up quit match dialog
3) saves spell log preferences instead of resetting it every match

Track stats live while in-game
Mod will display:
Total damage dealt
Total damage to each player
Total healing given
Total healing to each player
Score based off of kills, damage, healing, captures, & souls
Saves a .txt & a .csv file log in your MWW directory of past game stats.

Additional Features:
Ability to leave any game at any time by pressing SHIFT + ESCAPE
Spell log showing past spells you have used
Removes the old Death Message popup (I plan to add this to kill log instead)
