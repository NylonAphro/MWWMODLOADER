Hold down "ctrl" for a couple seconds in-game to see a tutorial, or see the included README file
This mod:
• Lets you toggle parts of the in-game HUD on/off
• Optionally shows HP numbers above people's floaty HP bars
• Shows you what map is coming up in the lobby ahead of time

v2: fixed crash when death is summoned
v3: fixed crash if someone alt+f4'd and also changed the main hotkey from "h" to "ctrl"
