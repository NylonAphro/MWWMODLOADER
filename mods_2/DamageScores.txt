Damage Scores Version 1.2
Please message me if there is anything horribly game breaking.

UPDATE 1.1
Level System is back
Level will display on all clients, and show in the Top Wizards section of the leaderboard

Features
Adds level system back into the game
Score based off of kills, damage, healing, captures, and souls
Track stats live while in-game:
  Total damage dealt
  Total damage to each player
  Total healing given
  Total healing to each player

Additional Info
XP at end of match is converted directly from your score. A win grants a 2x multiplier.
Score is calculated with below formula
(Damage Dealt + Healing Given + ((kills + (assists / 2) + (points captured * 2) + (soul pickups / 10)) * 10000))/1000
