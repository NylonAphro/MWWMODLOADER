Instructions 

This guide assumes you already have the Magicka: Wizard Wars client patch 2.6.0 installed.
This guide also only works if you do not have the mod loader installed.

How to Install

1) Extract the "Magicka Wizard Wars Premade Mod Packs.zip" file
2) Select *ONE* of the included packs (included are packs 1 to 3)
3) Open the premade pack folder 
4) Copy/replace "data_win32_bundled" & "DataManager" into your Wizard Wars Steam folder. By default it is in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MagickaWizardWars"
5) If your pack includes the Matchmaking Plus mod, also copy the Match History folder over to the same location
6) Launch game

How to Uninstall

1) Copy Pack 0 into your MWW steam directory (same as installation)
2) Make sure it asks to replace files, if it does not you have done something wrong (probably copied to wrong folder).
3) If you want to remove the flappy wizard texture delete "b2e35f17ff93e706.patch_0" from the "data_win32_bundled" folder
4) Launch Game
